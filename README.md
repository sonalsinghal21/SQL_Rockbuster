### Skill:
**Cleaning data**: checked and addressed duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values.

**Joining tables**: selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.

**Descriptive Statistics**: explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complicated questions.

**Coding with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: designed CTEs that would make code more readable and easier to reuse.

**Reporting results**: a Powerpoint presentation with answers to key questions and recommendations. 

### Tools:

PostgreSQL, Tableau, PowerPoint
