Here is the SQL query with common table expression:

WITH Average_paid_amountCTE(customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT  A.customer_id , A.first_name AS customer_first_name, A.last_name AS customer_last_name, D.country, C.city,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid  FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'Teboksary', â€˜Tianji', 'Cianjur', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY country, city, first_name, last_name, A.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC LIMIT 5) 
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average FROM Average_paid_amountCTE
